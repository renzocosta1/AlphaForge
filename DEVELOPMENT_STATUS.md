## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Bugs

### High Priority
1. **Corporate Action Detection Integration Bug**
   - **Issue**: Corporate action detection logic exists but is not being triggered in the main application
   - **Symptoms**: Companies with clear stock splits/reverse splits (SITE, XXII) are not being flagged
   - **Status**: Logic works in isolation, integration issue suspected
   - **Location**: `data_ingestion/data_fetcher.py` - `_detect_potential_corporate_actions()` method
   - **Next Steps**: Debug data flow from fetcher to quality filters

2. **Data Flow Validation**
   - **Issue**: Need to verify data correctly flows from `data_fetcher.py` ‚Üí `weschler_filters.py` ‚Üí GUI
   - **Impact**: Some filter results may not be displaying properly
   - **Status**: Needs investigation

### Medium Priority
3. **Rate Limiting Optimization**
   - **Issue**: Current rate limiting may be too conservative
   - **Impact**: Processing time longer than necessary
   - **Status**: Needs performance testing

4. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - **Issue**: Some edge cases may not be handled gracefully
   - **Impact**: Application may crash with malformed input
   - **Status**: Needs comprehensive testing

### Low Priority
5. **GUI Responsiveness**
   - **Issue**: GUI may freeze during intensive processing
   - **Impact**: Poor user experience during long operations
   - **Status**: Consider threading improvements
